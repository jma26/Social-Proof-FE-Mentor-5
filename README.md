## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I found the mobile-first workflow to be a lot easier than the desktop version. Mobile design was straight forward while the desktop design was a little bit more intricate in my opinion. Overlapping lenghts of the star rating took a bit of time to figure out, but was somewhat able to do it with `gridbox`.

Likewise with the previous challenges. I had a hard time finding the optimal `background-size + background-position` for the desktop, mobile background patterns.
